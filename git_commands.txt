# Step 4: Push to GitHub
git push origin master

# Alternative if you're on main branch:
# git push origin main

# If this is your first push or you need to set upstream:
# git push -u origin master

# If you encounter authentication issues, you may need to:
# 1. Use Personal Access Token instead of password
# 2. Or configure SSH keys
# 3. Or use GitHub CLI: gh auth login
